Slides and example code for my talk entitled *Interactive visualization in R* at ODSC East 2016.

Requires the following packages from CRAN:

```r
install.packages(c("sp", "ggplot2", "ggmap", "rmarkdown",
  "tufte", "flexdashboard", "threejs"))
```

Also requires the following package from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/leaflet")
```

An up-to-date version of RStudio is also recommended.
